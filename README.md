# Cash-Flow-Statement-ANNA-COCONUT-TRADERS
Anna was a young entrepreneur who had always dreamt of starting his own business.
He had a passion for trading coconuts and had been planning for years to start his own coconut trading business. 
Finally on 1st January, he  decided to take the leap and started â€˜Anna Coconut Trader' with an initial capital  of 1 crore rupees.
The first thing Anna did was to purchase a mini truck for transporting coconuts from the farms to his warehouse.
He also bought a building to use as a warehouse and furniture to store coconuts. All these assets were purchased with the cash he had on hand.
**They took a loan of Rs. 20,00,000 in the beginning of January**
To understand how the cash flows are generated by the company, they  want to divide the cash flows in three categories: operating cash flow, investing cash flow, and financing cash flow. 
They knew that by separating these cash flows, he could get a better understanding of how his business was doing. 
Anna was very pleased with the first month of his business. He had made a net profit and had managed to keep his operating expenses under control. 
He knew that running a successful business would require him to keep a close eye on his cash flows. He has asked your advice on how the company is doing on the cash flow front. 
He also wants to understand the position of assets and liabilities of the business.
